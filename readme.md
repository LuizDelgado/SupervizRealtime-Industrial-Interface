### üìà About SuperViz and Its Role in the Project

*SuperViz* is a cutting-edge technology that enables real-time communication and presence tracking in collaborative environments. In this project, *SuperViz SDK* serves as the backbone for real-time communication between the Festo industrial plant and the frontend, ensuring that data is continuously transmitted, processed, and visualized without delay. This continuous data stream allows stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and respond to production metrics instantaneously.

*Why SuperViz is Essential*:
- *Instantaneous Monitoring*: Provides real-time visibility into production, supporting immediate reactions to efficiency changes.
- *Future Applications*: SuperViz can be expanded into remote monitoring for complex systems, predictive maintenance, and more advanced industrial monitoring, making it an invaluable tool for digital transformation in manufacturing.

## üìë Project Structure
The backend architecture is divided into two components to ensure robust communication between the plant and the dashboard:
1. **Backend on Raspberry Pi**: Runs a Docker container to communicate with the Festo plant via `pymodbus`. Data collected is sent to **Gemini AI** for advanced insights, such as production time analysis.
2. **Backend 2 on Node.js**: After insights are generated, data is passed to Backend 2 using the **SuperViz real-time SDK** for immediate storage in **MongoDB Atlas**. This setup enables instant visibility of production data on the frontend, hosted on **Vercel**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard and Data Visualization
The dashboard, built in React, showcases real-time production data through an interactive interface, including:
- **Color-Coded Production Counts**: Silver, Red, Black parts produced.
- **Last Produced Item**: Details of the most recent part, including production time and Gemini‚Äôs insights.
- **Performance Graphs**: Production times and efficiency metrics visualized in real time.

## üîÑ How Real-Time and AI Integration Elevate Industrial Monitoring
The real-time SDK by **SuperViz** is central to this project, providing an uninterrupted data flow from the production floor to the user interface. Coupled with **Gemini AI‚Äôs deep analysis**, the application does more than just report data ‚Äì it contextualizes information, helping users understand performance trends, anticipate production times, and identify potential efficiency improvements.

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Functionalities Enabled by SuperViz and Gemini
1. **Instant Production Monitoring**: Using SuperViz, production updates appear in real-time, allowing a proactive approach to monitoring.
2. **Advanced AI Insights**: Gemini delivers insights such as production speed analysis and anomaly detection, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
3. **Interactive Dashboard Visualization**: The dashboard displays color-coded production data, time trends, and detailed analysis for a comprehensive view of the production process.

## üèóÔ∏è Development Status
**Current Status:** In Development üöß  
This project is actively being developed as a proof of concept, with upcoming improvements focusing on expanding real-time interaction capabilities and enhancing AI-driven insights. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to drive the project forward.

   cp .env.example .env
   

3. Install dependencies:

   bash
   npm install
   

4. Start the Docker container on Raspberry Pi:

   bash
   docker-compose up
   

5. Ensure the Raspberry Pi is connected to the Festo industrial plant and receiving data via pymodbus.

#### Node.js Backend

1. Navigate to the Node.js backend folder:

   bash
   cd backend/nodejs
   

2. Install dependencies:

   bash
   npm install
   

3. Set up the environment variables for MongoDB, SuperViz, and Gemini in the .env file.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

## üéØ Running the Project

After completing the installation steps, run both backends and the frontend simultaneously to connect the data pipeline.

### Backend (Raspberry Pi)

bash
cd backend && docker-compose up


### Backend (Node.js)

bash
cd backend/nodejs && npm start


### Frontend

bash
cd frontend && npm start


The frontend should now be accessible on your local server (e.g., http://localhost:3000), displaying real-time data from the Festo plant through the SuperViz-powered pipeline.
